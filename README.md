## About it
Algorithm is tool for exercising our thinking patterns, and we can strengthen the ability to convert mathematical models into code. Whether you are engaged in artificial intelligence, in-depth learning, or advanced software development, no matter what language you use, such as C#,C++,Java,python,etc., and applying the most appropriate algorithm is always the most important point when faced with a specific problem. *Every problem in practice has its own particularity, which makes it not that easier to choose the most appropriate algorithm.* How do we write the algorithm that most efficiently apply to a practical issue? **Yes, LeetCode.** You can write an algorithm until it accepted, and do not rush to do the next question, and learn the solution someone else has submitted, `so you can solve the problem from the ability of solving the problem to that fast and efficient realm`. 

I create this respository called **leetcode-csharp** because I apply C# language to solve LeetCode and `every day` will update it and also publish it in `CSDN blog`(http://blog.csdn.net/daigualu) my blog column(http://blog.csdn.net/column/details/14761.html) Also, I will put some algorithm ideas that famous scientists have created on [My Wiki for this repository](https://github.com/jackzhenguo/leetcode-csharp/wiki) such as [Flody tortoise and hare](https://github.com/jackzhenguo/leetcode-csharp/wiki/Floyd's-Tortoise-and-Hare) and [KMP](https://github.com/jackzhenguo/leetcode-csharp/wiki/KMP-getNext) and so on. 

Anyway, welcome to view, star and fork, then contribute.
